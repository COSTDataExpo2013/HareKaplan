CommuniD3, with its use of linked plots and user interaction, allows for the discovery of features and trends in the data that are far more difficult to discover with static plots alone. By creating the tool prior to analyzing the data, we were able to find stories in the data that may not have been as readily apparent otherwise. Specifically, we uncovered an especially strong link between quality of education and Community Attachment in the Great Plains, the importance of Social Offerings in Myrtle Beach and Biloxi, and slowly recovering economic attitudes in the Rust Belt.

While the interactive tool is specialized for this particular dataset, the philosophy and ideas behind its creation hold for other data and applications. By empowering the user to guide his or her own discoveries, the analysis of data can be completed by subject-matter experts in their fields who may be less technologically inclined. The flexibility and ease of \texttt{Shiny}, combined with the interactivity of \texttt{D3} will hopefully open up a whole new set of possibilities for analyzing complex datasets more easily.
