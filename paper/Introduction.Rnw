This work was part of the American Statistical Association's Data Exposition 2013. The dataset came from the Knight Foundation's `Soul of the Community' project \citep{SOTC}. For this project, the Knight Foundation in conjunction with Gallup collected surveys from 43,000 people in the years 2008, 2009, and 2010, in 26 U.S. communities. Additional details on the 2013 Data Expo and the underlying data sets can be found in \cite{dataexpo}. A map of the 26 communities and the geographical regions to which we assigned them is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:region_map}. The regions are the Great Plains, the West, the Deep South, the Southeast, and the Rust Belt. These regions were not included as part of the dataset, but rather were our own constructs created by a graphical exploration of the locations of each community. We roughly based these regions on the US Census regions and divisions of the United States map \citep{Census}. We did not strictly adhere to state boundaries, but rather looked at the proximity of individual cities to the surrounding communities.

The survey contained raw responses as well as derived metrics that we used to gain insight into what makes a community thrive. The metrics we used can be found in Table~\ref{tab:metrics}. Each metric was calculated as a simple average of the response to anywhere from 2 to 6 questions. The metrics gave insight into how residents felt their community rated on various dimensions. For example, Education covered both public education as well as higher education in the community, while Social Offerings dealt with both nightlife as well as neighborliness. Community Attachment combined questions on how proud residents were to live in their community, if they would have recommended the community as a place to live, and how they predicted the community would be in five years. A score of 5 indicated the most positive response was given on all questions that this metric is derived from. We used the 10 metrics in Table~\ref{tab:metrics} to find relationships within types of communities to Community Attachment, as well as to explore any notable regional differences.

The goal of our work was to facilitate understanding of why people feel attachment to their communities through the use of an interactive and web-based visualization. Specifically, we took the point of view of a community planner, either from one of the communities in the study or from a community in the same region or a similar urbanicity. By putting the user in the driver seat of their own experience, we allow the user to apply the conclusions of their interaction to their own situation. The purpose of interaction is to discover what the data has to tell the world. We did not attempt to draw statistical conclusions about the data, thus we did not use the survey weights provided in the data in our analysis. Because the communities are sparsely and unevenly distributed throughout the United States, we felt an exploratory approach would help us to sift through the data and discover its patterns.

Many of the discoveries in the data were readily apparent, while others required some more investigation. In the words of John Tukey, ``Exploratory data analysis is detective work - numerical detective work - or counting detective work - or \emph{graphical detective work}." \citep{tukey77} Dynamic, interactive visualizations can empower people to explore the data for themselves as well as encourage engagement with the data in a way that static visualizations cannot. Additionally, linking multiple visualizations shows different aspects of a complex data set and helps highlight relationships. By allowing actions in one plot to affect elements in other plots, comparisons are made easy for the user without requiring much memorization. This aids in pattern finding by reducing cognitive load. In addition to wanting it to be easy to explore the data, we wanted the tool to be easy to use. A web-based application is platform-independent and allows the user to employ the tool without any software to download. Additionally, by building an application that works on all modern browsers and operating systems, there are no limitations on who can use the tool. Finally, automatic feature additions and bug fixes can be completed transparently to the user.

To fully engage the user with our work and facilitate the emergence of interesting or descriptive patterns we created CommuniD3 (available at \url{http://andeek.shinyapps.io/CommuniD3}), an interactive web-based tool that relies heavily on the idea of linked plots. A linked plot will adapt to changes made in other plots within the collection, creating a dynamic and interactive set of graphics. Different visualizations illustrate different aspects of the data, and linking helps regain the multidimensional aspect of the data \citep{buja1991interactive}. In the following section (Section 2) we discuss the structure and tools used to build CommuniD3. Section 3 highlights an application of CommuniD3 in finding interesting stories across the Unitied States. We finish with a conclusion in Section 4.
